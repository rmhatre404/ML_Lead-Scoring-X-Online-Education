# Lead Scoring X Online Education

## Problem Statement

An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses. They have a process of form-filling on their website, after which the company considers that individual as a lead. Once these leads are acquired, employees from the sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc.

Through this process, some of the leads get converted, while most do not. The typical lead conversion rate at X Education is around 30%. This means that if, for example, they acquire 100 leads in a day, only about 30 of them are converted. To make this process more efficient, the company wishes to identify the most potential leads, also known as "Hot Leads." If they successfully identify this set of leads, the lead conversion rate should go up, as the sales team will now be focusing more on communicating with the potential leads rather than making calls to everyone.

## Business Objective

Lead X wants us to build a model to give every lead a lead score between 0 - 100. This will enable them to identify the Hot leads and increase their conversion rate. The CEO aims to achieve a lead conversion rate of 80%. They want the model to be able to handle future constraints as well, such as peak time actions required, how to utilize the full manpower efficiently, and what should be the approaches after achieving the target.

In summary, the primary goals of this project are as follows:
- Develop a lead scoring model to assign a lead score to every potential lead.
- Increase the lead conversion rate from the current 30% to 80%.
- Ensure the model is adaptable to handle future constraints and can guide actions during peak times.
- Optimize the utilization of manpower.
- Define approaches for maintaining lead conversion rates after achieving the 80% target.

The project seems to revolve around building a predictive model that can help prioritize and target potential leads effectively to achieve the desired lead conversion rate. Additionally, it requires strategical insights for long-term success.

Please note that this README provides an overview of the problem statement and business objectives. More specific details, including data sources, methodology, and technical aspects, will likely be covered in other project documentation or code files.

leads.csv: This is likely a dataset containing information about leads. Look for it in the project repository's data folder or a folder named "data."

Leads Data Dictionary : contains the decsription about the lead parameters.

Python file: This could be the code or script used to build the lead scoring model. Look for it in the project repository's code or scripts folder. It might have an extension like .ipynb (e.g., "lead_scoring.ipynb").

Summary: A summary document might be in various formats (e.g., PDF, Word). It would typically be in the main project directory with name starts with "summary"

PPT files: PowerPoint presentation files is in a pdf format which has the information about our steps in building the model and getting the result.
